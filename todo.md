Things that I will be doing next
Just discussing my next steps in blogging

Mar 8, 2023

Hello ðŸ‘‹ It's been a very long time since I first published a blog here and many things changed on Hashnode. In my very [first post](https://mks.hashnode.dev/readme), I said that...

> I am only here to read articles of other developers and react & comment to their posts when I'd like to.

I am very consistent with that until now. I will be straight to the point and will not make this long.

I've decided that I will make this my Developer blog site. I will be posting here the story behind my projects as a developer. Not tutorials but stories about how I came up with a project, and so on.

Hope that you guys can also appreciate that!

What am I doing here?

Jan 27, 2021

> What am I doing here at Hashnode? Why am I not publishing any blog?

That's what always runs through my mind whenever I go here. It's been more than three months since I discovered Hashnode and almost everyone here is encouraging one another to start a blog.

> Can't I just read articles and not write one?

That's the reason I write this post, turn off the comments, hide from the community and clicked publish.

I am only here to read articles of other developers and react & comment to their posts when I'd like to. In that way, I am also learning new stuff and connecting to the community. I believe that Hashnode is not only for developers who write articles but also for those who just read like me. But I want to clarify that I do not forbid myself if ever I want to do blogging here in the future and I do not hate anyone. I honestly love Hashnode's community.

P.S. Right now, I only write personal blogs on my main [website](https://tinasalada.tk/). ðŸ˜Š
