This project of mine is called **Temperature Converter Web Application**. It's not new. It's a pretty old project. I created it 3 years ago. I will link it below if ever you want to check that out.

It's a pretty simple-looking project. Nothing to fancy about. But here's the story behind it...

I was just looking at my old-school files and then I found this folder of mine with a bunch of projects we coded at school using the C language. C is my first programming language so I got excited when I saw that files. One of them is a temperature converter. I immediately installed DEV C and run these codes with it. I'm so happy it still worked.

Then, my mind came up with the idea of making those C projects into a web application using vanilla JavaScript. At that time, I only have a little knowledge of JavaScript. Using that web app, you can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Celsius, and Fahrenheit to Kelvin.
