## About me

Mabuhay! I'm Tina from Palawan, Philippines. I write code for the web and blogs about web development, *[Baybayin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin) Tagalog and [Tagbanwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagbanwa_script)* scripts, and my personal and spiritual life. I have an [INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/89121c2e06f1d) personality. I love listening to music, and reading books and articles.

## About this website

This website is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The theme is [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) and I'm using my generated custom scheme called *Rose*. I write about making this website, see below.

My blogs for over the years are all over the place. There's blogs on WordPress, Blogspot, Webnode and so on. And I'm so sick of advertisments, restrictions and branding of these free website makers so I've been thinking for years of how I'm gonna get them all together in one place, and I think before this year ends, hopefully, I can do that on this website. I keep trying and trying for year but none of it suit my standards until now. I like using static site generators now like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). And I think this theme really suits my liking.
