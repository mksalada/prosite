# About me

Mabuhay! I'm Tina from Palawan, Philippines. I write code for the web and blogs about web development, *[Baybayin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin) Tagalog and [Tagbanwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagbanwa_script)* scripts, and my personal and spiritual life. I have an [INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/89121c2e06f1d) personality. I love listening to music, and reading books and articles.
