<code style="color:gray">.cf</code> - 'Yan ang extetion nang aking domain name. But I don't know what does it mean. Every domain extention has a meaning behind. It can be an abbreviation of a certain word. 

When I created this website, everything is free. I got a free domain name. If you know of [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com), yes, it's from them. I entered my domain name and I have to choose what extention I want to use from the five extentions that are free (<code style="color:gray">.cf</code>, <code style="color:gray">.tk</code>, <code style="color:gray">.ga</code>, <code style="color:gray">.ml</code>, and <code style="color:gray">.gq</code>). At first, I want <code style="color:gray">.tk</code> since my name has letters T and K but it's not working when I registered it so I choose again another extention and it's <code style="color:gray">.cf</code>. I choose it because I want to put a meaning behind it and for me, it means Christ Forever. 

Later on, I think after two days, I decided to search it's meaning and I found out that it means Central Africa. I'm shocked because I'm not from Africa but when I read whole page about it, I'm relieved because it says there that they created that extension so that the people from Central Africa can have there free websites and so, the other people also outside of Africa. Along with all of the free extentions, it's the same motive. 

Here's all the extensions and there meanings:

| EXTENSION                           | MEANING                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| <code style="color:gray">.tk</code> | Tokelau (a place at South Pacific)  |
| <code style="color:gray">.ml</code> | Malaysia                            |
| <code style="color:gray">.ga</code> | Gabon (a company name)              |
| <code style="color:gray">.cf</code> | Central Africa                      |
| <code style="color:gray">.gq</code> | Equatorial Guinea                   |

I'm so thankful for their kindness. I even created my dream own website for free because of that. I really appreciate it.
