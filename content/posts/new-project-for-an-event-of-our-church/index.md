I was working on a project for our church for more that a week now. We're having a family camp for the holy week. One of my church mates on media asked me if I could make a system for the registration and attendance. I accepted it because I can do it and of course, I would love to do it. I'm so confident that I told him that it'll be ready within a week. I published the repository on GitHub publicly but after some days, I made it private so you guys can't access it. I called it "**Family Camp Management System (FCMS)**".

Yesterday (Jan. 19, 2024), I realized I can't finished it within a week. There's a lot more things to do so I tried search for a web app that is similar to what I want to accomplish and I found one. I tried it and it was perfect. I found some issues but I think if I studied the code, I can fix it.

The only thing I regret about this journey is that I should do a research first before doing it. I'm so lazy to do things but confident to do it on my own without any help. And ended up seeking help because I'm lazy.

So I found a video on YouTube called "[Event Registration and Attendance System in php my sql with source code](https://youtu.be/j8oys4-eAFU)" by [1 Source Code](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZgUZtKv89aoj975Cl0wsfA) (Jun 26, 2023). I go to thier website and downloaded the app ([Event Registration and Attendance System in php my sql with source code](https://1sourcecodr.blogspot.com/2023/06/event-registration-and-attendance.html) by [1 Source Code](https://1sourcecodr.blogspot.com)). But then, I found the credit on the video and I looked for it. I found out that the original project/app is from [Event Registration and Attendance System using PHP/MySQLi with Source Code](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14599/event-registration-and-attendance-system-using-phpmysqli-source-code.html) by [Free Source Code Projects and Tutorials - sourcecodester.com](https://www.sourcecodester.com/). It was submitted by [oretnom23](https://www.sourcecodester.com/users/tips23) on Monday, November 16, 2020 11:52 (Language: PHP).

I searched 'oretnom23' on GitHub and I've found this account: [github.com/oretnom23](https://github.com/oretnom23). The application was made 3 years ago but it's alright. I couldn't ask for more. Big thanks to **oretnom23**, **sourcecodester** and **1sourcecodr**!

The original project wasn't on the GitHub account so I uploaded it on my account. I just called it "**Event Registration and Attendance System (ERAS)**". It was also a private repository. I haven't thought if I will make these repositories public so for now, please don't ask me about it. I made <code style="color:white">original</code> brach for the original version and the <code style="color:white">main</code> branch is where I will make the changes.
