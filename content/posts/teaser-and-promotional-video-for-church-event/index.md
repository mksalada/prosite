On my [previous blog](/posts/new-project-for-an-event-of-our-church), I told you guys that I'm working on a project for our church. It's for an event. That same event, I took the task of making a promotional video. The due date for it will be in 3-4 weeks but they also want me to create a teaser video within 2-3 days.

The making of that teaser video made me realized that I don't enjoy video editing or video making. I can look at the same code for like a hundred times but I cannot do that for a video. Then, I have to make anothe one, a promotional video which is much longer that a teaser video.

To be honest with you, I do not know how I'm gonna do the promotional video. I seek help from an AI and recycled the ones I used for the teaser video. Thankfully, I finished it all and I guess they like it.

The whole experience of it, I didn't enjoy it that much but I have to do it so it's kinda a little bit stressful. I just comfort myself by telling myself that I've learned new things about video editing from this experince so it's a win-win.
