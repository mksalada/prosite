We have a kinda like a mini seminar every Sunday after church service. They called it "Equipping". It's about life's purpose. Last Sunday, one of the things I've learned from that mini seminar is **to create products or services when there's a need and don't be just a consumer**.

Then, after that, one of our youth club committee suggested that we should automate our inventory system and logs. Now, I feel like I have to solve that need by making an application for that.

But... should I do that to every need we encounter?
