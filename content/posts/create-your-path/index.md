...a path must be walked by someone before it becomes a path, and that a waterway can be formed from that path
{{< /lead >}}

<br>

In the Korean TV series called "***Hwarang*: The Poet Warrior Youth**", I learned the phrase "**create your path**" from its male lead character named **Sun-woo**. I will not explain what's the whole story is about. You can look for it on the internet and/or watch it yourself. It's average but a good drama to watch. And then, just go back here again. But for the sake of context, I'll share some so you don't get confused. The story:

> It revolves around an elite group of young men called **Hwarang**, who discover their passion, friendship and love in the turmoil of the Silla Kingdom

<br>

In episode 6, the Hwarang boys had their first leasson from their master, **Hwa-gong**.

> The boys reconvene for their first lesson, and Hwa-gong shows them the character for “water.” He asks if water is weak or strong, and **Su-ho** [a high-breed Hwarang] responds that it’s strong, since it beats fire. **Ban-ryu** [another high-breed Hwarang] argues that water goes around any obstacles, which means it’s weak. **Ji-dwi** [the future king of Silla pretending to be a lowkey high-breed and joined Hwarang] speaks up, saying that water is kind — it brings life, and flows even to the lowest places.

<br>

The class goes on and their master gave them a test.

> Hwa-gong reveals the next character, the character for “king.” He says that their test is to debate what water means to a king, and that he expects them to reference a Chinese philosophical text for it.
> Hwa-gong singles out Sun-woo, asking what he thinks. Sun-woo says that water is exhausted, since it produces things like fish and gold until it dries up.

<br>

Then, in the next episode, the day for the test came. Master Hwa-gong reminded them that if they fail, they could be kicked out of the Hwarang school.

> Hwa-gong grades the tests, and Ban-ryu’s essay seems to garner the most approval. The rest don’t do so well, and he fusses at the boys for not having any important thoughts.
> He comes upon Ji-dwi’s and Sun-woo’s pages, and holds them up. He asks them to explain their short, simple answers, or risk failing. Ji-dwi says arrogantly that the author of the Dodukyung (the Chinese philosophical text they’re supposed to answer from) didn’t always answer on paper. Hwa-gong turns to Sun-woo, who says that he doesn’t know enough characters to write what he wanted to answer.

<br>

Master Hwa-gong wants Ji-dwi ans Sun-woo a chance to explain their answer.

> Ji-dwi goes first, and he quotes a saying, “The law follows where the water flows.” But he notes that some land is dry and some is rich, and that following the flowing path gives strength in harmony. “That is the king’s rule and the king’s way,” he concludes.
> Sun-woo speaks up, calling that a load of bullcrap. He says that Ji-dwi’s answer makes the lower class the roots and the foundation. He says that waterways flow high to low, so where does the water at the bottom go?
> Sun-woo says that a path must be walked by someone before it becomes a path, and that a waterway can be formed from that path. He says it’s the law to turn away dry and infertile land, so if that dry land is the king’s path, he shouldn’t continue to be king.

<br>

All failed the test except for Ban-ryu and Ji-dwi.

> Hwa-gong hands out failing grades freely, and Han-sung, Su-ho, and Yeo-wool all fail. Ban-ryu passes, as does Ji-dwi. Sun-woo is failed, not because his answer was bad, but because he didn’t use the proper reference material to back up his answer.
> After dismissing the others, Hwa-gong reminds Sun-woo that he only has two more chances, then he’s out.

<br>

But for Ji-dwi, Master Hwa-gong should have passed Sun-woo too.

> Later, as he fishes in the pond, Hwa-gong repeats Sun-woo’s answer to himself, secretly impressed. Ji-dwi approaches to ask why Hwa-gong failed Sun-woo, since he knows that Hwa-gong feels the same about the high-borns as Sun-woo does. Hwa-gong asks what king could look up and see things from below, and Ji-dwi counters that a hidden king could.
> Hwa-gong scoffs, asking what a sequestered child could possibly do. He has no faith that a young, useless king could oppose strong officials, and he worries that the king will come back soon and create anguish for Silla. He says this is why he created the Hwarang — to protect Silla’s future.

## Before it becomes a path, it MUST be walked first

To have a pathway towards your dreams or goals, you must walk and create a path first.

I can't remember how many times and how much I cried because I know what I wanna do and I enjoy doing it but people doesn't see it nor appreciate it. There are times I'm so hopeless. There are moments I feel like what I'm doing is meaningless. That I'm going to this walk alone. I'm scared. I have anxiety. I don't have to talk to. I have no courage left. Yes, I went to those darkest moments in my life.
